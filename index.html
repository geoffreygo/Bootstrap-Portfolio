                        I live in Denver, Colorado with my wife and 3 dogs. Yes 3. I'd like to say I'm the man of the house (being the only man in
                        the house) but the truth is that my dogs pretty much run me. They'd prefer if I didn't have to work, so that
                        we could visit parks, find new things to smell, and discover edible tidbits wherever we go. Unfortunately, someone
                        has to pay the bills, so I have some explaining to do every morning as I leave the house. They are unmoved though,
                        and act like leaving them is the biggest betrayal that they have ever experienced.
                    </p>

                        On the upside, my return home is a cause for manic celebration. There is barking, howling, and jumping as they swarm me in
                        their joy. Each day is subject to a level of jubilation that would lead one to believe I had just returned from
                        a month-long trip. This is what I must keep in mind as I face their dejected little faces each morning: that
                        I will cause them unprecedented frolic before the day is out. Each homecoming is a new holiday.

                        But what, you say, is this work I mention in passing? I've spent close to two decades doing techy things for techie companies
                        while trying to keep up on the latest tech. My latest ambition is web development, which is very techy indeed.
                        If you'd like to know more, feel free to get in touch with me via the Contact page. Now excuse me as I go and
                        spread more joy.
